## A Search for QPOs in the SDSS Stripe 82 Quasar Sample

We are searching for a statistical QPO signal in the SDSS Stripe 82 quasar sample, by computing power spectra for each AGN in each filter, and then combining them. A simple stacked power spectrum in observed frequency may wash out the signal, despite the sample being fairly tightly clustered in Black Hole mass and redshift. A more sensitive approach is to infer the hyper-parameters that govern the QPO population - how their strength scales with BH mass, AGN luminosity and so on - *hierarchically*, given all data.

This is work in progress: please cite "Levine et al, in preparation", and get in touch if you are interested!
